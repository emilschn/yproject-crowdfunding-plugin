A crowdfunding platform in the likes of Kickstarter and Indigogo

== Description ==

Crowdfunding by [Astoundify](http://Astoundify.com/) is a funding platform for WordPress. An extension that seamlessly integrates with [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/), the Crowdfunding plugin lets you crowd source everything from films, games, and music to art, design, and technology.

"Backers" can pledge specified amounts of money towards a project and receive rewards for their contributions. Pledge amounts are only collected if a campaign reaches its goal in the time specified.

Run your own crowdfunding website for anything you can imagine.

Note: The Astoundify Crowdfunding plugin is designed to work alongside the PayPal Adaptive Payments or Stripe gateway so that pledges are collected but no funds are taken until the campaign reaches its goal. The plugin will also work along side any other gateway that Easy Digital Downloads supports but funds will be taken immediately.

= Features =

Features of the plugin include:

* Crowd fund anything you want!
* Frontend form submission to easily collect campaign information.
* Compatible with Stripe & PayPal Adaptive Payments API for pre-approved purchases. When a person commits to funding your project they are only charged if your campaign reaches its pre-defined goal.
* Compatible with all standard payment gateways that Easy Digital Downloads supports, i.e Stripe, PayPal Pro/Express (payments will be charged immediately).
* Works both as a donation plugin and a Crowdfunding plugin.
* Easy to theme and integrate into your own site which uses Easy Digital Downloads.

= Premium Themes =

We currently have two compatible themes that have been released:

* The first theme released is called "Fundify" from [Astoundify](http://Astoundify.com/fundify.html) A large community crowdfunding theme, like Kickstarter or Indiegogo.
* The second theme released is called "Campaignify" from [Astoundify](http://Astoundify.com/) A multi-purpose crowdfunding theme, great for single project crowdfunding.

= Get Involved =

Developers can contribute to the source code of the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/Astoundify/crowdfunding)

= Does this plugin work with any theme? =

Yes. However, it won't look much different than a standard EDD install. Templates must be modified/created to output relevant crowdfunding information (display amount funded, etc).
